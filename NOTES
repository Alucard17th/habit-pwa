🔹 1. Polish User Flows (MVP readiness)

Habit Creation / Edit page XXX
Right now you can create habits, but do you have an edit habit form (name, frequency, target, reminder time)?
Add a /habit/:id/edit route with MUI form so users can update habits.

Confirm archive/unarchive?  XXX
Optional, but some users like a confirm step to prevent mistakes.

Better empty states XXX
Eg. “No habits yet → Create your first habit” with a CTA button.

🔹 2. Notifications / Reminders XXX

Add reminder_time support:

Backend: already on habits table.

Frontend: allow users to set it (time picker).

PWA: show local notification (“Don’t forget to drink water”) at reminder time (use Service Worker + Notifications API).

🔹 3. Analytics & Insights XXX

Weekly/monthly charts (use recharts, already installed).
Examples: streak history, completion % by week.

Show best streak habit and weakest habit as motivational highlights.

🔹 4. Monetization (important for extra income 💰)

Lock some features behind Pro: 

Example: more than 3 habits → paywall. XXX

Export data as CSV/JSON → Pro only. XXX

Integrate a simple payment flow (Stripe, LemonSqueezy, Gumroad). <!!!!!!!>

Backend: toggle user.is_premium after payment → frontend unlocks features. <!!!!!!!>

🔹 5. PWA polish

Add install prompt and app icon (manifest.json + icons).

Enable service worker caching (serviceWorkerRegistration.register() in index.tsx).

Test offline mode thoroughly (progress logs sync correctly when back online).

🔹 6. Deploy & Feedback

Deploy backend to a small VPS / Laravel Forge / Render.

Deploy frontend (PWA) to Netlify or Vercel.

Invite a few testers → gather feedback.
